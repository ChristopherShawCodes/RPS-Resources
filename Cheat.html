        <h1>Per SOP</h1>
        <br>
        - When a file comes to RPS it should be “ready to send to insurance company” meaning that,
        advisor reports should be ran, all “reasonable 11’s” should be cleared or documented.
        <br>
        Reman bumpers (Bay Area & First Quality bumpers) and used parts from weirdo vendors that do not bid in parts trader
        should be verified. 
        <br>
        Estimate should be exported to Nex and work order should be opened.
        <br>
        - OPS does not export back to ccc, please check prices in parts trader and check for better deals, but any
        price or part changes (ie. oem price matches via ops) for parts ordered via ops need to be manually
        changed in CCC, and most times marked as ordered in nex in purchase assistant, unless your store has
        been linked to ops most have not. 
        <br>
        <br>

        Parts trader- does export back to ccc for parts price changes which need to be addressed, and stores
        are linked to parts trader, but always check to make sure that they are marked ordered in Nex via
        purchase assistant.
        <br>
        <br>
